## Stack Technical Overview

The architecture of a Scroll SDK chain is based on Scroll, and the architecture specifics of a Scroll SDK chain will match what Scroll's network. For more information on how Scroll works, please see the [Technology](/en/technology) section.

The articles in this section will be focus on the various parts a Scroll SDK chain operator will need to deploy and run.

## Scroll SDK Repo

Scroll SDK can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/scroll-tech/scroll-sdk). The repo is private, so please ask a member of the Scroll team for access.

The repo consists of these major components:
1. Example config files for various customizations *(see [Customization](/en/sdk/technical-stack/configuration))*
1. Helm charts for deploying the necessary services and contracts *(see [Services](/en/sdk/technical-stack/services))*
1. A docker image for building the correct configuration files for these services *(see [Smart Contracts](/en/sdk/technical-stack/contracts))*
1. An Ansible playbook for setting up a zk prover *(see [Proof Generation](/en/sdk/technical-stack/proof-generation))*

## Deployment Process

<Aside type="danger" title="On-going issues with arm64">
As of July 22, 2024, if using `arm64` architecture, you will likely have issues with some services, including `rollup-explorer-backend`. You can follow our [ARM64 on Mac Guide](/en/sdk/guides/run-on-arm64-mac), but some services will not be supported.
</Aside>

### PreReqs

To run a local devnet with all services running on a single machine (using minikube), you’ll want the following items installed from a base Ubuntu installation:

Before getting started, be sure to install the following:

- [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) (or Docker Desktop)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
- [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) (for local dev cluster)
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)


### Deployment

<Steps>
1. Modify `./charts/scroll-stack/config.toml` with your settings and accounts.

    For more information on modifying config.toml, see [Customization](/en/sdk/technical-stack/customization).

2. Modify `./charts/scroll-stack/values.yaml` to disable any unneeded services.

    For more information on which services to set `enable:true`, see [Services](/en/sdk/technical-stack/services).

3. Bootstrap all Helm dependencies and config files by running:

   ```bash
   make bootstrap
   ```

4. Launch the Scroll SDK services by running:
   ```bash
   make install
   ```

5. Wait for services to start and contracts to deploy, and you've got a new Scroll SDK chain!

</Steps>
